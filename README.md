#Linux Commands Notes for DevOps

This repository contains Linux command notes that I have explored and practiced as part of my DevOps learning journey. These commands are essential for working with servers, automation, CI/CD pipelines, system monitoring, containerization, and cloud deployments.

I will continue updating this documentation as I learn new concepts, tools, and commands while working on real-world DevOps practices.
